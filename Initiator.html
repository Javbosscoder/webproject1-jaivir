    <h1>Initiator</h1>
<br/>
<h2>Gekko</h2>
<!--Tags should always be only lowercase!
-->
<p>Utility and Mobility: Gekko is known for his versatile utility. His Mosh Pit ability, which works like a bomb, can clear enemies from spots and provide a unique area control tool.
    Adapting in Combat: His Gekko's Wing ability gives him the ability to quickly move around the map, adding a dynamic level of mobility for both aggressive plays or escapes.
    Objective Play: Gekko's Resilience can allow players to revive teammates quickly, creating opportunities for team plays and making him a valuable team asset for clutch moments.
</p>

<h2>Breach</h2>
<p>Disruptive Utility: Breach is an excellent initiator. His abilities like Flashpoint and Aftershock can disrupt enemies by blinding them or forcing them out of cover, making him great for initiating team fights.
    Area Control: His Fault Line can stun enemies in a large area, allowing your team to push with ease. This ability is perfect for clearing chokepoints and controlling key areas.
    Strong Ultimate: Rolling Thunder is one of the most effective ultimates in Valorant, as it stuns and disorients all enemies in its path, making it extremely powerful for site execution or retakes.
</p>

<h2>Fade</h2>
<p>Stealth and Vision Control: Fade specializes in tracking enemies. Her Seize ability disables the movement of enemies while revealing their position, giving her team key intel.
    Psychological Warfare: Nightfall, her ultimate, sends out a wave that can disorient and silence enemies, taking away their ability to react in high-stress situations. She excels in turning the tide of fights by controlling the battlefield.
    Tracking: Her Prowler ability can seek out enemies, blinding and disorient
</p>
<h2>Kay/o</h2>

<p>Suppression: KAY/O is great at shutting down enemy utility. His ZERO/point suppressor disables enemy abilities in a wide radius, making it easier to execute strategies without worrying about opposing abilities.
    Aggressive Utility: FRAG/ment is a grenade that can be used to clear tight spaces or deal damage in multiple ways. It’s versatile and allows KAY/O to set up kills or force enemies to move.
    Team Support: His NULL/cmd ultimate disables enemy abilities within a large radius and gives KAY/O a boost of power when enemies are caught within it, making it a great tool for offensive pushes.
</p>

<h2>Skye</h2>
<p>Healing and Support: Skye is a dedicated support agent. Her Regrowth ability heals allies, keeping them alive during fights. She also has a Healing Blossom ability that can fully restore health over time, making her a key sustain agent.
    Utility for Vision and Recon: Her Trailblazer ability sends out a blinding projectile that can disorient enemies, and her Guiding Light flashes enemies around corners.
    Area Control with Ultimate: Skye’s Skye’s Nature ultimate lets her plant healing zones on the map, which can keep her team healthy while they push or hold a site.
</p>

<h2>Sova</h2>
<p>Recon Specialist: Sova is fantastic for gathering information. His Owl Drone allows him to scout areas, while his Recon Bolt reveals enemy positions, making him a great intel gatherer.
    High-Damage Utility: His Shock Bolt can deal significant damage in an area, especially in tight spaces, and can force enemies to move or take damage.
    Global Ultimate: Hunter’s Fury is an excellent tool for tracking and dealing damage from a long distance. It’s especially useful for post-plant situations or when you know the enemies are hiding in specific areas.
</p>
<h2>Tejo</h2>
<p>Tejo is weak in solo gunfights (unless you're good with your aim and game sense), due to the lack of flash. In a solo queue, especially if you're team doesn't communicate, Tejo will be difficult to play with. He at least needs a good team, needs to support the team, and communicate with the team. His kit and ult should be for clearing, taking spaces, and disrupting enemy positions for the team. His not Breach, where you can use your flash or utility not just for taking space, but also easy frags. Something that Tejo doesn't have. His kit must be used for a purpose. I think Tejo's Sub-class is more on Crowd Control, or stalling. In casual or normal games, he may be mid to great. In pro play, potentially a big threat if done correctly. especially with a great team.</p>

<h3>This \/ will be you if you play initiator, you will be the IGL/team leader.</h3>
