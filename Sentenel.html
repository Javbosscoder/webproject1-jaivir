    <h1>Sentenel</h1>

<h2>Killjoy</h2>
<!--Tags should always be only lowercase!
-->
<p>Area Control: Killjoy's abilities, like Nanoswarm and Lockdown, make her fantastic at controlling key areas. The Lockdown ultimate can completely shift the tide of a round by disabling a whole team in an area, setting up easy kills or an easy plant/defuse.
    Traps & Utility: The Turret is great for gathering information and slowing enemies, while her Nanoswarm grenades can catch enemies off guard and deal significant damage. This makes her incredibly useful for post-plant defense and preventing pushes.
    Versatility: She can be used both defensively and offensively, depending on how the player chooses to set up her abilities. This makes her adaptable in many scenarios.
</p>
<h2>cypher</h2>
<p>Intel Gathering: Cypher's Spycam provides valuable intel on enemy positions, often allowing his team to plan their next move based on where enemies are or when they are rotating. His Trapwire can also catch enemies off guard, providing instant intel and slowing them down.
    Area Denial: His Cyber Cage creates effective chokepoints, making it harder for the enemy team to push or escape from certain areas. His kit can break enemy pushes by disrupting their movement.
    Neural Theft (Ultimate): Cypher’s ultimate is incredibly valuable, as it reveals the positions of the remaining enemies on the map after a kill. This is crucial in turning a 1vX situation into your favor.
</p>
<h2>sage</h2>
<p>Healing & Sustain: Sage is the only agent with a consistent healing ability, making her an essential support character. Her Healing Orb can turn a teammate's life around mid-fight, keeping them alive for crucial rounds.
    Reviving Teammates: Her Resurrection ultimate can be game-changing, especially in clutch moments. Bringing back a teammate mid-round can give your team a huge advantage, especially if it’s a key player or an aggressive duelist.
    Area Denial & Control: The Barrier Orb is excellent for locking down tight spaces, blocking sightlines, and preventing pushes. This gives her team opportunities to re-position or defend key sites effectively.
</p>
<h2>Chamber</h2>
<p>Long-Range Dominance: Chamber is deadly at long-range engagements. His Tour De Force ultimate gives him a powerful sniper rifle that guarantees a kill with a single shot. He can create angles where the enemy has little chance to fight back, especially if he's using Rendezvous to quickly reposition.
    Self-Sufficiency: Chamber can function almost independently. His Trademark slows enemies, allowing him to take shots from a distance or reposition safely, while his Headhunter gives him a semi-auto pistol with high damage that can act as a backup in tight situations.
    Mobility & Flexibility: The Rendezvous ability allows him to teleport to a set location, giving him the ability to escape dangerous situations or rotate quickly, keeping enemies guessing.
</p>
<h2>Deadlock</h2>
<p>Space Control & Disruption: Deadlock's GravNet ability can catch enemies off guard by disabling their movement. This can be crucial in preventing aggressive pushes or stopping an enemy's momentum during a site retake.
    Protective & Defensive Play: Her Barrier Mesh can help fortify positions or choke points, giving her team better control over an area or slowing down the enemy's approach. This allows for better positioning and strategy on the map.
    Ultimate for Control: Deadlock's Anchored Force is a strong control tool, creating barriers that limit the enemy’s movement, allowing for strategic plays and team coordination to lock down crucial areas or prevent flanks.
</p>
<h2>Vyse</h2>
<p>Space Control: Her Razorvine and Shear abilities allow her to block off important areas, slow down enemies, and even trap them in tight situations. This makes her incredible at holding sites or controlling chokepoints.
 Ultimate Impact: Her Steel Garden ultimate is fantastic for disrupting enemies. It can effectively trap and disarm enemies, which can completely change the outcome of a round. Vyse can be used in both defensive and offensive situations, making her a flexible and reliable choice for any team strategy.
