    <h1>Controller</h1>
<h2>Clove</h2>
<!--Tags should always be only lowercase!
-->
<p>Scottish troublemaker Clove makes mischief for enemies in both the heat of combat and the cold of death. The young immortal keeps foes guessing, even from beyond the grave, their return to the living only ever a moment away.
Unique Support and Aggression Combo: Clove has a great balance between offensive and supportive abilities. Her Pick Me Up lets her recover quickly after engaging, which gives her great sustain during fights.
Resurrection Potential: With her Not Dead Yet ultimate, Clove can come back into the round even after dying, creating opportunities to turn the tide of the match with aggressive play.
Versatile Utility: Her Meddle and Ruse abilities allow her to control enemy positioning and vision, enabling her to disrupt the enemy team while supporting her own.
</p>
<h2>Omen</h2>
<p>Excellent Smokes: Omen’s Dark Cover allows him to block enemy sight lines from long distances, which is a big asset for both attacking and defending. He can use this to help his team push or prevent enemy pushes.
    Flexible Movement: His Shrouded Step gives him mobility to reposition or escape tricky situations. It’s great for flanking or getting out of tight spots.
    Global Impact with Ultimate: Omen’s From the Shadows ultimate can teleport him across the map, which can be a game-changer in disrupting enemy plans or gathering critical intel.
</p>
<h2>Brimstone</h2>
<p>Powerful Smokes: Brimstone’s Sky Smokes are easy to place and have a long duration. These smokes are great for blocking key sightlines during site pushes or post-plant.
    Area Control: His Incendiary ability provides area denial, forcing enemies to either take damage or move into open spaces.
    Stim Boost for Team: Brimstone's Stim Beacon can help his team perform better, giving them a rate of fire and reload speed increase—useful for high-intensity fights.
    Strong Ultimate: His Orbital Strike is a great zoning tool. It can clear out areas and flush enemies out of cover, often securing a multi-kill.
</p>
<h2>Astra</h2>
<p>Complete Map Control: Astra’s Stars are incredibly versatile and can be used for smokes, concussive blasts, or gravity wells. She controls the flow of the game with these.
    Strategic Depth: Astra’s Astral Form lets her control parts of the map remotely, making her a strong controller and utility-driven agent.
    Cosmic Divide Ultimate: Her ultimate is one of the best for disrupting enemy positions. It creates a wall that cuts off vision and audio, making it perfect for isolating enemies or securing a site.
</p>
<h2>Viper</h2>
<p>Area Denial: Viper’s Toxic Screen and Poison Cloud abilities allow her to block sightlines and restrict enemy movement. She excels in denying areas, forcing the enemy to take unfavorable routes.
    Strong Post-Plant Utility: Her Snake Bite ability is perfect for post-plant situations. It forces enemies to either take damage or retreat from the spike area.
    Ultimate for Control: Viper’s Pit is a game-changing ultimate for area control. It reduces enemy visibility and health when they enter, making it a powerful tool for retaking or holding sites.
</p>
<h2>Harbor</h2>
<p>Unique Water-Based Smokes: Harbor's Cove provides shields of water, blocking sightlines and protecting teammates. This is a nice mix-up to the usual smokes in Valorant, giving players more creative options for pushing or holding.
    Slow and Block Enemy Movement: High Tide creates a wall that slows and blocks enemies. It’s useful for controlling choke points or delaying enemy pushes.
    Strong Ultimate: Harbor’s Reckoning ultimate is a great area-control tool, capable of disorienting enemies and setting up opportunities for your team to make a play.
