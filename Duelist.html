    <h1>Duelist</h1>
<br />
<br />
    <p> The first duelist is going to be Jett, the face of the game and first thing that comes
        to your head when you think Valorant. if you dont go outside this agent is for you or if you look like this all day</p>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542751371-adc38448a05e?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="Jett" width="450" height="450">
        <h2>Jett</h2>
    <p> Representing her home country of South Korea, <b>Jett's</b> agile and evasive fighting
 style lets her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish,
  cutting enemies before they even know what hit them.
  The best part about playing Jett is you are the most agile agent in Valorant.
   This gives you the advantage of being aggressive and duel-friendly. Always peek early from
    strong angles and use your abilities to get out of enemy situations.</p>

<h2><b>Reyna</b></h2>
<!--Tags should always be only lowercase!
-->
<p>Forged in the heart of Mexico, <b>Reyna</b> dominates single combat,
 popping off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her raw skill,
  making her highly dependent on performance. Reyna is a potent choice for climbing ranks in Valorant, especially if you're confident in your shooting skills. Often favored by players on smurf accounts,
   her self-sufficient kit allows dominant players to control the pace of the game in lower elo matches.
   but a down side of reyna is if you dont get kils you will be useless and you team will bully you.</p>

<h2>Phoenix</h2>
<p>Hailing from the U.K., <b>Phoenix's</b> star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his own terms.
he is great for solo queing because he has everything you need a flash a fire wall for healing and cover, and a fire ball for healing blocking off points and lineups.
Phoenix is definitely popular, he's amazing in solo queue but he's just outclassed by other duelists once you get to higher ranks, where teamwork actually matters. He still has his niche mostly with his ult being so cheap yet so strong. Movement abilities are just naturally better for entry.
</p>
<h2>Raze</h2>
<p>
    <b>Raze</b> explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns. With her blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose of “boom.”
    Raze is arguably the best duelist in valorant right now and playing her isn't as simple as most of the other characters in the game. She has so much potential, and having a raze on your team can often be the decider in winning your team games.
    Keep in mind however that Raze can still receive fall damage despite being immune to the explosion damage. Raze's ultimate is a rocket launcher that deals incredible damage in large AoE. Anywhere you go, on any map you play, Raze is always effective
</p>
<h2>Iso</h2>
<p>Chinese fixer for hire <b>Iso</b> goes into a flow state to dismantle the opposition. Reconfiguring ambient energy into bulletproof protection, he advances with focus towards his next duel to the death.
    Opinions on Iso's effectiveness are divided. Some players, like schittbritt, advocate for playing Iso if you enjoy his playstyle, disregarding the opinions of those who criticize him. According to NebulaPoison, Iso's lack of movement and flash abilities make him a subpar choice as a solo duelist.
    Iso is a great agent. Just know as you climb the ranks, people will have similar or better aim than you. They will know how to counter Iso's shields, so it's good to learn better timings for your shield. Example would be that when you Iso ult (with shield), they will jump spot right click with a class to break it.
</p>
<h2>Yoru</h2>
<p>Japanese native <b>Yoru</b> rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where to look.
    Yoru is a good agent, but you need to throw some games to understand his true power and potential. Abilities that can fake your position in this game are really broken. Without good timings and gamesense it's hard to play him.
    i think if you understand how to play yoru he is good but for some one who is trying him you might say he is trash just give it a try and practice and you can be like forsaken.
</p>
<h2>Neon</h2>
<p>Filipino Agent, <b>Neon,</b> surges forward at shocking speeds, discharging bursts of bioelectric radiance as fast as her body generates it. She races ahead to catch enemies off guard, then strikes them down quicker than lightning.
    Originally from the Philippines, Neon is considered one of the best Duelists in the game, with a very advanced skillset. Players will need to master her movements and her abilities if they wish to make a huge impact with her in the match and against her enemies.
    though after the nerf neon is still strong.
